**自傳**  
從小生長於一個普通的家庭，父母都是小學老師，在於人格的培養方面比較屬於嚴格管教，造成後天的自我警惕不能違背良心而行事。  
本人個性屬於喜好科學，新知，創新甚至於部分哲學方面，對於不理解的知識會存在很強的探索興趣，甚至不眠不休的研究學習。  
對於科技領域一直是最感興趣的部分，從Apple II的BASIC語言，IBM PC的組合語言，C語言一直到最近的Python語言都是不斷學習的項目，意識到未來人類除了要會與人類溝通的能力以外，還要懂得如何跟機器溝通，在不久的將來會是機器掌管人類的時代。
就業後從半導體產業開始，然後進入手機通訊，機械加工，基本上將產業的上下游都走了一遍，這件事其實對自我的能力有很大的助益，明白產品在什麼情況下會對下游造成什麼樣的影響，甚至發生了異常主要屬於哪一個製程為主要因素都可以容易的分析出來，這是一輩子在同一個生產線無法獲得的經驗。

**Biography:**  
My father and mother had been elementary school teachers. They were affecting me very much. Such as been like reading multi-type books, smart thinking and good behavior …etc.  

At the moment, when I was junior high school student, I was like to play computer. When I was at Province Ping Tong High School, I went to participate computer program design race. I got the 3rd rank award of the south at Taiwan.  

When studied at National Cheng Kong University, I used internet to contact many people all over the world; by the way I improved my English ability. 

Been a student of Industrial Management Science Department, I understood the Industrial and Business management knowledge. It is very useful in my work .
I have good emotion quality, and desire to solve problem. I was learn many knowledges by myself for work. I hope I will be the expert on the field.  

My first job was been an IE engineer for building material company, then I transferred to IC assembly factory (WALSIN Electron Company), I was a production supervisor in WALSIN, my work was to control products and operator.  

When I leaved WALSIN, I joined to another IC assembly/testing factory (Siliconix, Vishay, U.S.), this factory is locate at Kaohsiung, To be an  IPQC engineer, my job was to manage inspectors, review SPC, reply customer complain (8D), doing internal audit. I had get ISO/QS 9000 internal audit certification, and passed TS16949 certification, I have the TS16949 internal auditor qualification.  

After that, I joined Motorola personal communication section; to be a DQE engineer for ODM management. My job is to control ODM quality, it include incoming inspection, production quality audit, outgoing quality control and end user complain review. From Motorola system, I had learn many quality control method and reliability system, especial for mobile phone production system.  

For doing so many works, I’m lucky to learn many skill of different fields, such as Semiconductor, Electrical Assembly, Mechanical produce and serviced many great companies of the world. I think that I can doing better for work according to  those experiences from co-work with customers and learning by myself.
